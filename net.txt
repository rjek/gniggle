Gniggle Networking Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gniggle has two network protocols - one for discovering game servers, and
another for the games played on the game servers.  They are both simplistic
and plain text.  The intention has been that the servers can be simply
implemented in very high-level languages, such as Lua or Python.

Game Discovery Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TCP protocol on port 14547.  On connecting, the server will return a list
of servers, along with information about them.  You may also send back a single
server description in the same format as the ones you received at add it to
the server's list of games.  If the server already has a knowledge of a server
at the specified host and port, it'll replace any previous record.  It will then
disconnect you.  (If you only wish to get the list, connect, and send a newline)

The format of a game record is a single line, in the following format:

  HOST:PORT:WIDTH:HEIGHT:COMMENT STRING\n

A game metaserver is at liberty to refuse to accept listings from hosts whose
IP address does not match what is mentioned in the HOST part.

A game server should periodically reconnect to the meta server to refresh its
listing.  Every 5 minutes is suggested for this, and a 10 minutes record expiry
is suggested for implementations of the meta server.  A game server must refresh
its listing if an aspect of the game changes, such as its dimensions or the
comment string.
