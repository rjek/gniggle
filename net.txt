Gniggle Networking Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gniggle has two network protocols - one for discovering game servers, and
another for the games played on the game servers.  They are both simplistic
and plain text.  The intention has been that the servers can be simply
implemented in very high-level languages, such as Lua or Python.

Game Discovery Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TCP protocol on port 14547.  On connecting, the server will return a list
of servers, along with information about them.  You may also send back a single
server description in the same format as the ones you received at add it to
the server's list of games.  If the server already has a knowledge of a server
at the specified host and port, it'll replace any previous record.  It will then
disconnect you.  (If you only wish to get the list, connect, and send a newline)

The format of a game record is a single line, in the following format:

  HOST:PORT:WIDTH:HEIGHT:COMMENT STRING\n

A game metaserver is at liberty to refuse to accept listings from hosts whose
IP address does not match what is mentioned in the HOST part.

A game server should periodically reconnect to the meta server to refresh its
listing.  Every 5 minutes is suggested for this, and a 10 minutes record expiry
is suggested for implementations of the meta server.  A game server must refresh
its listing if an aspect of the game changes, such as its dimensions or the
comment string.

Game Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The game protocol is also simple.  It is a simple tag-based protocol that is
plain text.  Each line sent by either the server or the client is prefixed with
a tag that describes which part of the protocol it applies to, followed by a
space.  Tags used by the server are:

	* HELLO - Line describes protocol version spoken by server
	* MOTD - Line is part of the MOTD.  Multiple lines may occur
	* GAMETYPE - Line specifies what the game type is.  Also used to
	             notify clients of the game type changing.
	* GAMEDATA - Line specifies the data for the game, such as the cube
	             contents and what time limit there is
	* TALK - Line is some text produced by the chat system
	* TIMELEFT - Line describes how much time is left
	* ANSWERS - Line described all the answers the server got
	* SCORES - Report the score of other players
	
Tags used by the client:
        * QUIT - Disconnect
        * SAY - chat text
        * GUESS - transmit a guess to the server to judge
